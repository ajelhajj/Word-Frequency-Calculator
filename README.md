# Word-Frequency-Calculator
This program that reads in the contents of a text file and displays a histogram of the frequency that words appear in the text. It does this by:

- Prompting the user to enter the filename of a text file 
- Reading the contents of that text file and counting the number of times each word appears in the file 
- Storing the words and associated counts in a dictionary as key-value pairs 
- Displaying a histogram using asterisks representing the frequency that the words in the file appear

A sample text file (futuristicViolence.txt) is included in this repository for testing. This file contains a passage from the novel "Futuristic Violence and Fancy Suits," by David Wong.
